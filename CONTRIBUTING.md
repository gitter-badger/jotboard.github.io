# Contributing to Textnet

> We welcome Feature Requests and Bug Reports, please read these guidelines before submitting though.

<span class="warning">**Words that begin with the at sign (`@`) must be wrapped in backticks!** </span>. As a courtesy to avoid sending notifications to any user that might have the `@username` being referenced, please remember that GitHub usernames also start with the @ sign. If you don't wrap them in backticks, users will get unintended notifications from you.

GitHub has other great Markdown features as well, [go to their help page to find out more](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

## Reporting an Issue

We only accept issues that are inline with the avalible categories. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Textnet Core. Please read the following guidelines before opening any kind of issue.

1. ** Search for existing issues.** Since this is the one and only place to submit reports, its likely that we could get a lot of duplicate issues being submitted, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix being under development.
2. ** Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in Textnet's Code with [reduced test cases](http://textnet.github.io/#bugged) that should be included in each bug report.
4. ** Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and browser. Describe how you use Textnet, and try to include steps to reproduce the bug.
5. ** If you have a solution or suggestion for how to fix the bug you're reporting, please include it, or make a pull request - don't assume the maintainers know how to fix it just because you do.

## Feature Requests

Side-note: Feature Requests are almost always accepted (depending on whether its safe for work or not) and are nested into the submenu.

* Please search for existing feature requests first to see if something similar already exists and if it exists in the submenu on the actual site.
* Include a clear and specific use-case. We love new ideas, but we do not add features without a good reason.
* Consider whether or not your feature would be better as a function or implemented as a default interaction such as Groupies.

## Pull Requests

_Pull requests are encouraged!_

* Start by forking the Textnet Repository.
* Then attempt to modify parts that seem to be in need for a change.
* If your pull request solves an existing issue, but it's different in some way, _please create a new issue_ and make sure to discuss it with the main contributors. Otherwise you risk your hard work being rejected.
