### Reporting an Issue
<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

We only accept issues that are inline with the avalible categories and labels. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the core, if the following isnt possible, it'll make it a little harder for us to figure out the issue. Please read the following guidelines before opening any kind of issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** Since this is the one and only place to submit bug reports, its likely that we could get a lot of duplicates, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix being in development.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in Textnet's code with [reduced test cases](http://textnet.github.io/#bugged) that should be included in each bug report.
3. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and browser. Describe how you use Textnet, and try to include steps to reproduce the bug.
4. **If you have a solution or suggestion for how to fix the bug you're reporting, please include it, or make a pull request** - don't assume the maintainers know how to fix it just because you do.

### Feature Requests
<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

<sup>Side-note: Feature Requests are almost always accepted (depending on whether its safe for work or not) and will be nested into the <a href="https://textnet.github.io/#menu">submenu</a> if they get suggested.</sup>

1. Please search for existing Feature Requests first to see if something similar already exists and if it exists in the submenu.
2. Include a clear and specific use-case. We love new ideas, but we don't add features without a good reason.
3. Consider whether or not your feature would be better as an optional function (HashMod) or implemented as a default interaction like Groupies.

### Pull Requests
<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

_Pull requests are encouraged!_

1. Start by forking the Textnet Repository.
2. Then attempt to modify parts that seem to be in need for a change.
3. If your pull request solves an existing issue, but is very different in terms of its appeal to users, _please create a new issue_, make sure to discuss it with the Repo's Maintainers. Otherwise you risk your hard work being rejected

<sup>Side-note: You can also keep your version of the Repo and have it as your own, just keep your modified version of Textnet and have some fun.</sup>
